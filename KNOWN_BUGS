Major bugs
----------


bug 1

Bad interpretation of a goto inside a loop. It generates too much loops.
example :

    if (i == 1) {
        printf("1\n");
        goto next;
    } else {
        printf("2\n");
    }

    while (i < 1) {
        printf("loop\n");
        if (j == 6) {
            printf("3\n");
        } else {
            printf("4\n");
        }
next:
        if (j == 5) {
            printf("5\n");
        } else {
            printf("6\n");
        }
        i++;
    }




Minor bugs

bug 1

"jmp register" can't be interpreted. It can occurs sometimes with
a switch. An error message is printed and propose an other alternative
with the option --dump, which disassemble only.


bug 2

fusion of cmp/jumps, sometimes the cmp instruction disappears.

example : if the two "if cond_3" are exactly the same instructions (at the
same address, because we fuse the cmp and the jump, the second cmp disappears.

    # cmp
    # jump
    if cond_1 {

        # cmp
        # jump
        if cond_2 {

            # cmp
            # jump
            if cond_3 {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    else {
        # jmp
        if cond_3 {
            ...
        }
    }
