Minor bugs
----------


bug 1

"jmp register" can't be interpreted. It can occurs sometimes with
a switch. An error message is printed and propose an other alternative
with the option --dump, which disassemble only.


bug 2

fusion of cmp/jumps, sometimes the cmp instruction disappears.

example : if the two "if cond_3" are exactly the same instructions (at the
same address), because we fuse the cmp and the jump, the first is deleted
and the second disappears.

    # cmp
    # jump
    if cond_1 {

        # cmp
        # jump
        if cond_2 {

            # cmp
            # jump
            if cond_3 {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    else {
        # jmp
        if cond_3 {
            ...
        }
    }


bug 3

The pefile library seems to be bugged. Sometimes the function 
pe.load_import_symbols fails because the internal function of pefile,
parse_data_directories, throw an exception.
